# Inventory Management App
Inventory Management App was created as my capstone project and is the culmination of my BS SWE degree at Western Governor's University. It is configured to run with my Spring Boot application, deployed separately. It operates dual permissions for general users and admin (manager) users to handle and update current inventory details for any relatively small sales operation. This deploy is for a boutique clothing store called Rose's Closet. 

Upon login, the general user can view the current inventory of the store, and can filter, run and print reports.

Upon login, the admin/manager user has full CRUD functionality for the inventory, including price and other status changes, as well as marking items as sold or purchasing additional items.


...MORE INFORMATION TO COME...

*Note: this application  was initially created as a monorepo on my Gitlab account. Gitlab permissions made it difficult to untangle the application so with a little help from a kind [friend](https://github.com/yibbidy) we got this decoupled so I could continue getting my front-end and back-end repos deployed separately.*



## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - even though I understand that this has been deprecated. (Old habits die hard.)
